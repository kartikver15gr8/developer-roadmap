# Functions
In general, a method/function is a way to perform some task. Similarly in programming like Java, A method of function is a block of code that is written to perform a specific task again and again.
It provides reusability of code. We write the function once and use it many times. It works on the 'DRY' principle i.e "Do not repeat yourself".
